## About
FibroVision is a machine learning project focused on automating the classification and analysis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) through chest CT scans. By integrating advanced image processing with clinical data, this tool aids radiologists in diagnosing IPF more quickly, accurately, and consistently. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) powered by OpenCV to recognize and predict disease progression, supporting timely medical intervention.

## Features
# Automated IPF Detection:
Utilizes CNNs to classify IPF progression in chest CT scans, reducing diagnostic time.
# Clinical Data Integration: 
Incorporates Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and other clinical data to improve classification accuracy.
# User-Friendly Interface:
Designed for easy interpretation by radiologists.
# Consistent and Objective Diagnoses: 
Eliminates subjectivity, providing reliable support for decision-making.
# High Efficiency: 
Processes large datasets, meeting the growing demands of medical data analysis.

## Requirements
# Hardware:
Processor: Dual Core 2.00 GHz or higher
RAM: 2GB minimum
Storage: 120 GB hard disk
# Software:
Operating System: Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
